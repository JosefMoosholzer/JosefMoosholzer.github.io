# Obsession
When I was just getting into high school I loved to play Travian, a massively multiplayer online (MMO) video game. You started with a medieval village of a tribe you selected and had to construct and upgrade buildings or resource fields to prosper, until you were able to research and train an army to fight battles with and/or against other (real) players. The crux of this game was, that it did not end after an hour or two. No, it lasted months!

Constructing buildings lasted hours or even days, troops travelled minutes or hours, based on the distance and their speed. So I used every single minute I could, accessing a computer to log onto my account and take care of my village, distributing resources or sending orders. I always tried to grow faster than any of my neighbours, so I could outnumber them with my army and loot their silos. However, there is always a bigger fish, so eventually a stronger player attacked me and, if they felt like it, burned my town to the ground.

Having had school during the time plus 4 to 5 days of soccer per week I stood no chance against players that worked in offices, capable of regularly logging into the game. Activity was the biggest advantage one could get. And so, I learned to not bother resisting. Instead, I picked a different, newer world (server) and began anew, repeating the hopeless undertaking.

But during all this, I still very much enjoyed the game. Especially the feeling of a new start, founding a new village, repeating the beginner's quests, scouting my new neighbors, and dicovering the unknown was mesmerizing to my younger self. Over the years, I developed the habit of enjoying fresh starts. A blank canvas, a fresh task, was all I needed to lose myself in the moment and devote my whole attention to it. Once I knew how to solve the problem, the subject lost its mistery, its magic. It became a tidious chore and the obsession faded. It was less the challenge and failure that made me quit, but the boredom.

# Long-term growth vs. fast-paced cognition
Over the years I learned that sticking to a skill is part of what makes you great at it. School forced my to learn a subject for at least a quarter. In university I had to attend courses for a semester, and for my thesis I had to manifest a topic for about a year. In my current job, I am sticking to a project for over a year now.

At the same time, I picked up small hobbies or new skills, that were just as quickly dropped as my Travian villages burned down. The limiting factor, however, is not a stronger player, with more free time than me, but the way I approach the learning process.
Sticking to the obsessive behavior I developed as a child, I find myself learning or developing new skills for hours and days. Sleepless nights turn the exploration into an unpleasant experience, which affects my interest in sticking to the newly acquired skill. They might lead to the fact that I finish a 28 weeks course in just 4 weeks, whilst still studying and working 20 hours a week.
