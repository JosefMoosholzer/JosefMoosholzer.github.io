# the Idea
Having the whole month of February off, I took the time to reflect a little on my life. There I thought about the habits that I wanted to take into my upcoming job, and so some of my effort went into conceptualizing a morning routine. At the end of this two and a half hour long routine I am supposed to workout, before heading to work.

So far, I have been very succesful with my routine, but since the routine is compressed of many activites, I have not much time to make up a workout in advance. Though I know what muscle area I will do once I am at the gym, I don't feel inclined to make up an exact workout for that session. And since I don't wanna pay 20â‚¬/month for an app, just to do exactly that, I came up with the idea to create a web-application that generates a set of exercises for me, which should dictate my workout or at least provide some sort of inspiration for that day.
