# the Idea
Having the whole month of February off, I took the time to reflect a little on my life. There I thought about the habits that I wanted to take into my upcoming job, and so some of my effort went into conceptualizing a morning routine. At the end of this two and a half hour long routine I am supposed to workout, before heading to work.

So far, I have been very succesful with my routine, but since the routine is compressed of many activites, I have not much time to make up a workout in advance. Though I know what muscle area I will do once I am at the gym, I don't feel inclined to make up an exact workout for that session. And since I don't wanna pay 20â‚¬/month for an app, just to do exactly that, I came up with the idea to create a web application that generates a set of exercises for me, which should dictate my workout or at least provide some sort of inspiration for that day.

# the Prototype
At first, I did not consider building a web app, and instead I remembered the [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) SMS notifier that I once set up. I liked this option, because it made it possible to send the generated workout to my phone, where it was saved in an SMS. However, there are certain draw backs to Twilio.
- You are given a certain budget for free, whereas every SMS sent consumes some of it.
    - There would have been enough budget left for about 30 SMS
- You can only send SMS to phone numbers that have been verified previously.
    - New users, wouldn't be able to receive any workouts until I registered their number, and they clicked the registration link
