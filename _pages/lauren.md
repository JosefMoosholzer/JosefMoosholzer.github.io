IF YOU READ THIS, THEN THE LETTER IS NOT READY YET!
PLEASE COME BACK LATER...


Hey Lopo,

first I wanted to write you a letter to say sorry. 
But I guess, the flowers were beautiful enough.

Hence I planned on telling you about my current feelings and insecurites, which we shortly discussed on Monday night. 

But then this morning happened, and I was very upset. So I changed my intentions to writing you a critical note about my frustrations I have with you lately. 

And then you were very loving again, which kept my rollercoaster of emotions going. 

In the end I will touch upon all three, to maybe also get my own thoughts and feelings in order.

# I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt you. I just came out it in the heat of the moment. 
It hurts me watching, the way you just shut off. Storming around the apartment, reckless in every way. I encountered these types of situations with my mum as well. Blocking everything I say. It's frustrating, incapable of getting through this invisible wall, and to intervene kindly.
So I said what I felt. "You are a mess!!". Your room is a depiction of yourself, and now you are destroying furniture that's not even yours. I had to say something. Otherwise I would have had to recycle a bunch of wood.
I wanted to shake you out of your trance. 
But apparently I pushed you off the cliff...

# Do you still love me?


# Do you hate me!


I love you üòò
