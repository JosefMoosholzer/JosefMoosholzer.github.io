On the <a href="/welcome/">welcome page</a> you will find all the projects contributing to my portfolio. Each project will be described in more detail in each project but here is a quick summary nonetheless.

### Price Research

**Webscraping market competitors' prices on retailer websites** using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. Using pandas to read from and write to Excel files and pandas' DataFrames to manipulate, append, merge and display results. Idea stemmed from the **automation of a tedious task** at my IVECO working student position, and resulted in a pay raise.

### Data Analytics on Data Analytics

As a follow up to the Price Research project, I queried Indeed.com for jobs with the keywords Data Analyst & Scientist, and Business Analyst & Intelligence to **get a sense of the most demanded skills** for these positions, and **identifying employees with growing data teams**.

### Smaller Projects

Some projects that were **completed on behalf of online courses**. Every project covers a small part of what a Data Analyst job entails but **lacks in depth**, and does therefore not deserve further explanation. They are mostly there, waiting for me to pick them up and extend their scope.
